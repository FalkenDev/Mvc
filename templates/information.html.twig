        <h2>Welcome to Blackjack<h2>
        <p>The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</p>
        <p>Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.</p>
        <p>You starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.</p>
        <p>To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.</p>
        <p>If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.</p>
        <p>If you both get the same value ("push"), dealer wins automatically.</p>
        <p>Dealer will hit until the dealers cards total is 17 or higher.</p>
